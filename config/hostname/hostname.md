# Changing the Hostname

1) Edit /etc/hosts
2) Edit /etc/hostname
3) Commit Changes
4) Reboot


## 1) Edit /etc/hosts

At the terminal, type

    sudo nano /etc/hosts

Leave all of the entries alone except for the very last entry labeled 127.0.1.1 with the hostname “raspberrypi“. This is the only line you want to edit. Replace “raspberrypi” with whatever hostname you desire.


## 2) Edit /etc/hostname

At the terminal, type

    sudo nano /etc/hostname

This file only contains your current hostname. Replace the default “raspberrypi” with the same hostname you put in the previous step. 


## 3) Commit Changes

Commit the changes to the system and reboot the system for the changes to take effect.

    sudo /etc/init.d/hostname.sh

## 4) Rebbot

Rebbot the device:

    sudo reboot
